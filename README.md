# Winter Internship 2025

This repository serves as a comprehensive log of my progress and projects developed during the **Winter Internship 2025**. It consolidates and expands upon the work originally initiated in my **[Learning\_Pandas](https://github.com/Dharm3112/Learning_Pandas.git)** and **[Learning\_Python\_Form\_Scratch](https://github.com/Dharm3112/Learning_Python_Form_Scratch.git)** repositories.

## 📂 Repository Origins

This project aggregates content from the following sources to create a unified learning portfolio:

1.  **Learning Pandas**: Focused on data manipulation and analysis using the Pandas library.
2.  **Learning Python From Scratch**: Focused on core Python programming, OOP, and backend logic.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The project is organized into two main tracks reflecting the source repositories:

### 1\. Learning Python

A structured approach to Python programming, covering basics to advanced database integrations.

  * **Basics & Logic**

      * `01_Practice If Else Projects`: Conditional logic exercises (e.g., Age Group Categorization, Ticket Pricing).
      * `02_Practice Loop Projects`: Iterative solutions (e.g., Sum of Even Numbers, Exponential Backoff).
      * `03_Practice Function Problems`: Deep dive into functions, `*args`, `**kwargs`, and recursion.
      * `04_Scopes`: Understanding variable scope.

  * **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**

      * `05_Object Oriented Programming`: Classes, Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism, and Static Methods.

  * **Advanced Concepts**

      * `06_Decorators`: Timing execution and debugging function calls.
      * `07_Error_Handling`: Exception handling and file operations.

  * **Database Integration (Projects)**

      * `08_Database_sqlite3`: **YouTube Manager App** using **SQLite** for local data persistence.
      * `10_Python_mongoDB`: **YouTube Manager App** using **MongoDB** (NoSQL).

  * **APIs & Environment**

      * `09_Handling_Api's`: Working with public APIs.
      * `11_Virtual_py`: Managing virtual environments.

### 2\. Learning Pandas

Focused on data analysis structures.

  * **DataFrames**: Creating and manipulating DataFrames from dictionaries and lists.
  * **Series**: Working with Pandas Series.
  * **Operations**: DataFrame attributes, methods, joining, and concatenation.

## 🚀 Key Projects

### YouTube Manager App

A robust console-based application implemented in two versions to demonstrate different database technologies:

1.  **SQLite Version**: Lightweight, file-based storage for local management.
2.  **MongoDB Version**: Cloud-based storage using `pymongo` to interact with MongoDB Atlas.

**Features:**

  * Create (Add video details)
  * Read (List all videos)
  * Update (Edit video details)
  * Delete (Remove videos)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

  * **Languages**: Python 3.13
  * **Libraries**: `pandas`, `pymongo`, `sqlite3`, `requests`
  * **Tools**: Virtual Environments

## ⚙️ How to Run

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Dharm3112/Winter-Internship-2025.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to a project (e.g., SQLite App):**

    ```bash
    cd "Learning Python/08_Database_sqlite3"
    ```

3.  **Run the script:**

    ```bash
    python youtube_manager_db.py
    ```

4.  **For MongoDB projects:**
    Ensure you have the required dependency installed:

    ```bash
    pip install pymongo
    ```
